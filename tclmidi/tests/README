  Don't expect much from these tests.  They're basically just for
my benefit.  I used them to test the tclmidi commands as I created
them.  They don't do anything useful like give you a success/failed
message.  You must look at the code and figure out if they did the
right thing.
  The only reason I'm including them is so people can take a look
at the various syntax for the commands, and see simple examples of
how to use them.
