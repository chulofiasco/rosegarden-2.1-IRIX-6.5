INSTALLING THE MPU401 DRIVER
  Before installing tclmidi, you will need to decide if you
wish to install the MPU401 driver I have supplied.
Currently, I have drivers with the same interface for BSD/OS (formerly
BSD/386), Linux  and Unixware.  If you wish to install
a driver, go to the drivers directory (cd drivers) and
follow the instructions there.  For Linux and Unixware there are
makefiles that do most of the work.  For BSDI, you have to do
some things by hand.

INSTALLING THE TCLMIDI PACKAGE
  Before trying to build tclmidi, you will need to edit the Makefile.
It is chock full of comments and has default settings for many
machines.  Comment out the incorrect definitions, and uncomment
the correct ones.  This should be pretty straight forward.
  If you wish to build in support for the MPU401 driver, you
will need to define USE_MPU401 under MIDIDEF.  Without this definition,
you will still be able to build and use tclmidi, you just won't be able
to play or record.  If you define this, you should also define
your system type (BSD, linux, SVR4, etc.).  This definition controls
the location of the driver include file and some other minor
system incompatibilites.  The rest of the source is platform
independant and the definition isn't needed if USE_MPU401 is not
defined.
  Once you have customized the Makefile, you need only type
    make
and then
    make install.
  To install the man pages use
    make install-man-cooked
or
    make install-man-raw

  The man pages are written using the newer mandoc macros instead of
the man macros.  "Cooking" the man pages involves running them
through groff (you can use nroff if you want by editing man/Makefile),
and then installing the processed man pages.  The raw target installs
the man sources without processing them.

  If you want a version of tclmidi that includes tk support type
    make tkmidi
and then
    make install-tkmidi

  That should be everything.
