/*
 * Multiply two quads.
 *
 * Our algorithm is based on the following.  Split incoming quad values
 * u and v (where u,v >= 0) into
 *
 *	u = 2^n u1  *  u0	(n = number of bits in `u_long', usu. 32)
 *
 * and 
 *
 *	v = 2^n v1  *  v0
 *
 * Then
 *
 *	uv = 2^2n u1 v1  +  2^n u1 v0  +  2^n v1 u0  +  u0 v0
 *	   = 2^2n u1 v1  +     2^n (u1 v0 + v1 u0)   +  u0 v0
 *
 * Now add 2^n u1 v1 to the first term and subtract it from the middle,
 * and add 2^n u0 v0 to the last term and subtract it from the middle.
 * This gives:
 *
 *	uv = (2^2n + 2^n) (u1 v1)  +
 *	         (2^n)    (u1 v0 - u1 v1 + u0 v1 - u0 v0)  +
 *	       (2^n + 1)  (u0 v0)
 *
 * Factoring the middle a bit gives us:
 *
 *	uv = (2^2n + 2^n) (u1 v1)  +			[u1v1 = high]
 *		 (2^n)    (u1 - u0) (v0 - v1)  +	[(u1-u0)... = mid]
 *	       (2^n + 1)  (u0 v0)			[u0v0 = low]
 *
 * The terms (u1 v1), (u1 - u0) (v0 - v1), and (u0 v0) can all be done
 * in just half the precision of the original.  (Note that either or both
 * of (u1 - u0) or (v0 - v1) may be negative.)
 *
 * This algorithm is from Knuth vol. 2 (2nd ed), section 4.3.3, p. 278.
 *
 * Since C does not give us a `long * long = quad' operator, we split
 * our input quads into two longs, then split the two longs into two
 * shorts.  We can then calculate `short * short = long' in native
 * arithmetic.
 *
 * Our product should, strictly speaking, be a `long quad', with 128
 * bits, but we are going to discard the upper 64.  In other words,
 * we are not interested in uv, but rather in (uv mod 2^2n).  This
 * makes some of the terms above vanish, and we get:
 *
 *	(2^n)(high) + (2^n)(mid) + (2^n + 1)(low)
 *
 * or
 *
 *	(2^n)(high + mid + low) + low
 *
 * Furthermore, `high' and `mid' can be computed mod 2^n, as any factor
 * of 2^n in either one will also vanish.  Only `low' need be computed
 * mod 2^2n, and only because of the final term above.
