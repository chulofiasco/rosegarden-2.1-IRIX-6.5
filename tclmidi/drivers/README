  This is a device driver for MPU401 UART compatible MIDI controllers.
It used to be three separate drivers for BSD, Linux and SVR4 systems.
It is now one unified driver with small support files for each
individual system.

  Its features include:

  + the MPU401 is run in UART mode so the driver will (hopefully)
    work with MPU401 compatible cards that don't support
    the intelligent mode.

  + Reads/Writes data in Standard MIDI File event form.  Just
    grab an event from a Standard MIDI File and write(2) it
    to the device - the driver will do the right thing.

  + Supports open, close, read, write, ioctl and select
    system calls.

  + Supports an ASYNC mode.  The driver will send a SIGIO to the
    process group whenever data arrives or data can be written.

  + Automatic note off and controller reset on device close(2)

  + SMPTE timing support if you have a Music Quest card with
    SMPTE features.

  To install, Linux and Unixware have Makefiles.  BSDI has a
README with specific instructions.  Read the README for you
system and follow the instructions in it.

  The man page is written with the new mandoc macros as opposed
to the old man macros.  Berkeley is making this shift and
I'm following suit.  I don't know how available the mandoc
macros are, but groff comes with them.  There is a Makefile file
for making and installing the man page.  Edit it as necessary.

  The file PORTING contains instructions on how to port the driver
to a new systems.

  This implementation of the driver uses long longs when
converting SMF ticks to/from kernel ticks.  This is to
preserve accuracy.  Without using long longs, a long value
will overflow, or accuracy will be lost be dividing early.
Unfortunately doing long long math is costly and impacts
the system.  If someone is good with numerics and has a
good way of doing these calculations without losing accuracy,
or overflowing, please let me know.
