Rosegarden 2.1 installation
===========================

These instructions are for compiling and installing from the source
distribution of Rosegarden 2.1 for Unix.  Pre-compiled binaries for
Rosegarden are also available for some systems, from the ftp site
(ftp://ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/ROSE), and are generally easier
to install.


Building with "configure"
=========================

This release includes a new configure script built with the GNU
autoconf configuration utility.  To build with this configure script,
type

      rm -f Makefile
      ./configure
      make clean all

If something goes wrong, move on to:


Building without "configure"
============================

The file Makefile.noconfig is a complete Makefile for building without
using the configure utility.  Edit the definitions in the Makefile
carefully according to the comments in the file, and then type

      rm -f Makefile config.h
      ln -s Makefile.noconfig Makefile
      make clean all


Installation
============

To install Rosegarden once you've built it, run the script
"do-install" from this directory.

Alternatively, if you'd rather install by hand, carry out the
following.  (The final item here is something that might need doing
even if you've installed with do-install.)

  * move or copy the three executables ./bin/rosegarden, ./bin/editor
    and ./bin/sequencer to a suitable binaries directory (renaming
    them if you like -- you don't _have_ to call the editor "editor",
    though if I were you I'd call it that but put it in a Rosegarden-
    specific directory);

  * move or copy the two help files ./common/help/rosehelp.info and
    ./common/help/rosehelp.hnx into a directory you consider suitable for
    help files (they must be both in the same directory);

  * if desired, place the sample Rosegarden editor files
    ./common/music/*.rose in a suitable directory of your choosing;

  * if you want to use Petal scripting, and have Tcl and TclMidi
    installed on your machine and have successfully compiled the ./petal
    directory, then make a directory called .rosepetal-filters in your
    home directory and copy the sample files ./petal/harmonizer.tcl and
    ./petal/pattern.tcl into it;

  * if using the OSS MIDI driver, copy the default synth-patch files
    ./common/synth-patches/std.sb and ./common/synth-patches/drums.sb
    to a suitable directory;

  * modify the resource file ./Rosegarden to indicate the locations of
    the executable files, patch files and help files, and copy it to an
    X defaults directory (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults, your home directory,
    somewhere like that).  Rosegarden will refuse to run at all if this
    file has not been placed in one of the standard X defaults file
    locations.  You may also have to modify the colours and fonts defined
    in ./Rosegarden if the supplied ones are not available on your system.
