Porting attempts for Rosegarden 2.1
===================================

 IRIX 5.3 and 6.2
 Solaris
 Linux (a.out and ELF)
	These should all build okay; check out the various
	supplied Makefiles.  Binaries for SGI and Linux are
	available by anonymous ftp.

 IRIX 4.x, 5.2
	Use SYSTEM_ZILOG instead of SYSTEM_SGI.  Untested for this
        release.

 HP-UX 9, 10
	Should build, with Makefile mods; you probably shouldn't
	have to modify the source.

 IBM AIX
	Might build, with Makefile mods.  If you have the OSS sound
        driver, you'll probably be able to use it.

 SunOS 4.x
	Older versions of Rosegarden have been built under SunOS,
	though you'll need an ANSI C compiler (I used the C++
	compiler, and that was okay).  Don't know yet about this
	version.

Remember that whichever system you use, you'll need to have the Athena
libraries and headers (libXaw and the Xaw include directory).  This 
has been known to be a problem with HP-UX and AIX.

If you manage to port the system to something else, please let me know
-- especially if you had to modify the source to do it.  Why not
provide your own binary distribution? -- see scripts/make-bindist.sh.
