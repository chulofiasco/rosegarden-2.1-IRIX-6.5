Rosegarden 2.1 available
========================

Rosegarden is a free integrated musical notation editor and MIDI
sequencer for Unix/X platforms, with specific support for Linux PCs
and SGI IRIX workstations.  Binaries for these machines are available
by ftp, together with (we hope) fairly portable sources.

Version 2.1 is now available.  A number of new features have been
introduced since the previous 2.0.1 release.

See the Rosegarden Web page at http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/rose.html
for more information, or anonymous ftp to ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk,
directory /pub/dream/ROSE .
