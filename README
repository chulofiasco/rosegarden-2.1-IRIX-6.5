Support
=======

We're doing a certain amount of maintenance and development of
Rosegarden, but we don't support it as such.

However, if you have any complaints, bug reports, modifications, news
of successful or unsuccessful ports to other machines, or constructive
criticism, please email them to me.  (I don't particularly want to
hear about installation problems, but if you're really desperate, go
ahead and ask.)  A better idea, for some sorts of problems, ideas or
comments, may be to join and consult the Rosegarden mailing list: send
an email to the administrator at rosegarden-request@maths.bath.ac.uk
asking to be added.
