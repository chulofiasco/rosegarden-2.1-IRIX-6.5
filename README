Rosegarden 2.1
==============

This is the Rosegarden Editor and Sequencer suite, release 2.1.

See COPYRIGHT for information about copyrights, and COPYING for
information about redistribution and (the lack of) warranty.


Support
=======

We're doing a certain amount of maintenance and development of
Rosegarden, but we don't support it as such.

However, if you have any complaints, bug reports, modifications, news
of successful or unsuccessful ports to other machines, or constructive
criticism, please email them to me.  (I don't particularly want to
hear about installation problems, but if you're really desperate, go
ahead and ask.)  A better idea, for some sorts of problems, ideas or
comments, may be to join the Silicon Graphics User Group on Discord, as 
we have an engaging group of users who can lend support.

Installation
============

Use IRIX inst to install the tardist.

Set your TCLLIBPATH to "/usr/local/lib/tclmidi /usr/local/lib/rosegarden/petal"

Rosegarden main binary is in /usr/local/bin.

Have fun!
