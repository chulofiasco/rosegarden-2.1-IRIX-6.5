Changes from Rosegarden 2.0.1 to Rosegarden 2.1
===============================================

Editor
------

  * A full multi-level per-buffer Undo, with Redo, has been added.

  * Automatic chord naming has been added to complement the chord
    construction from names that was added to 2.0.1.

  * The Editor can now do some optional experimental velocity
    heuristics when writing out MIDI from a score with dynamic marks.
    `Dynamic' is now a distinct Text field type.

  * There is a new search-and-replace function on combinations of
    pitches in chords.

  * Output to OpusTeX and PMX are now included as an alternative to
    MusicTeX.  The OpusTeX output in particular needs more work, but
    from now on it'll probably get more development time than the
    MusicTeX code.

  * The Petal scripting language has been integrated, although so far
    only with an initial proof-of-concept interface.

  * The menus have been rearranged slightly.  There is a new Chord
    menu, and the Tools menu has disappeared and most of its functions
    moved onto File.

  * Cut and Paste now retain any complete slurs, ties or dynamics
    encountered.

  * The palette has been extended to include breves and breve rests.

  * There's a little vertical bar that follows the insertion cursor to
    track the insertion point (very exciting).

  * A keyboard control for Transpose Up/Down has been added.

  * The range of notes and rests available from the palette has been
    extended to include breves.


Sequencer
---------

  * The sequencing code has been completely rewritten for multiple
    simultaneous devices, with a new device mapper library.  You can
    send individual tracks to individual MIDI devices, and there is
    a new All Device meta-device which routes events to (surprise!)
    all the available devices.

  * You can now step forwards and backwards through the piece, and
    start playback at any point.

  * Selected tracks can be muted during playback.

  * The piano-roll now shows a piano keyboard layout, rather than
    five-line staff layout.  It now shows note velocity information,
    and is zoomable.

  * Events can be opened and edited from event-list windows with a
    double-click action.  All kinds of events can now be inserted
    from the Event List menu.

  * With a soundcard synth and OSS sound drivers, drum patches are
    available on MIDI channel 10 (represented as channel 9 in
    Rosegarden).

  * The MIDI menu Reset functions are (partly) implemented.

  * You can record while playing, although this hasn't been tested
    very thoroughly and shouldn't be expected to work reliably in
    this release.

  * The Petal scripting language has been integrated, although so far
    only with an initial proof-of-concept interface.


In general
----------

  * File boxes work a bit better: some obvious things that didn't
    work before now do (click on the file name field, type in the name
    of a directory and hit Return -- the directory will be listed in
    the expected manner)

  * The look and feel when using the 3d Athena widget set (Xaw3d) is
    slightly improved.

  * New "configure" and "do-install" scripts have been added to the
    source distribution.
